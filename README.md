# About Me

I'm a PhD candidate in Computer Science at UNSW Sydney and a LinkedIn Learning 
Instructor specializing in data science, machine learning, and AWS cloud 
technologies. With 10+ years of industry experience and a track record of 
teaching thousands of learners globally, I make complex technical concepts 
accessible and actionable.

I'm passionate about making technology education accessible to everyone.  As an AWS Data Hero, I'm committed to bridging the gap 
between cutting-edge technology and practical skills that empower careers.

# Projects & Technical Work

### DiverseClaire - AI-Powered Learner Simulation System
